		<h1>General</h1>
	<p>
		All beers are brewed using a process based on a simple formula. Key to the beer making process is malted grain, depending on the region traditionally barley, wheat or sometimes rye.
	</p>
	<p><br>
		The process in a nutshell is boiling malted grain, barley, wheat and rye for 60 minutes. Letting it cool, then pouring it into a bucket or carboy for 2 weeks.
	</p>
	<h1>Specific</h1>
	<p>
		Different types of beer need different things when being produced. It depends mostly on the recipe, of course. And that's described under the 'Recipes' section.
	</p>
	<h1>Bottling or Kegging</h1>
	<p>
		<h4>Bottling</h4>
		<p>
			Bottling your beer has its benefits. You can bring over a 6 pack to your friends house, or give it away as a gift. Who doesn't like that?
			<br>
			Plus, the bottles are reusable.
			<br>
			Bottling adds on time to getting to try it because you have to add sugar and more yeast to create CO2. 
		</p>
		<h4>Kegging</h4>
		<p>
			Kegging is useful if you're just going to have the brew at your place underneath a bar, or in a kegerator.
			<br>
			When kegging you don't have to wait for 2 weeks to bottle contition them.
		</p>
	</p>
	
	<h1>Sanitation</h1>
	<p>
		Sanitation, as with anything else you cook should be utmost a priority. Bacteria on any instrument that comes in contact with the beer can destroy an entire batch.
		<br>
		Typical 'brewers' grade items are Starsan, or bleach.
