		<h2>Societe Brewing Company</h2>
	<p>
		They have a handful of IPAs — five now by my count, and another four more non-IPAs, three of which are Belgian style beers.
	</p>
	<h2>Stone Brewing Company</h2>
	<p>
		What kind of a list would this be without Stone? Most people love it, some people hate it (or at least claim it’s overrated), but the craft brew giant’s influence on the beer world can’t be denied. Their Arrogant Bastard ale and love for “big flavor brews” put them on the map, but they’re also famous for their IPAs like Ruination, and their experimental and collaboration brews (like the Ishii/Stone Green Tea IPA).
	</p>
	<h2>Alesmith Brewing Company</h2>
	<p>
		Alesmith, known for their dark strong coffee beer is a major component to the brewing culture in San Diego. Their participation in the San Diego Brewers Guild and sponsorship of Craft Brew Week.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Mission Brewery</h2>
	<p>
		After moving into the historical Wonder Bread building downtown, this San Diego heavy hitter has been leaving a heavy impact into the scene.
