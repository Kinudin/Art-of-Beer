		<h2>Tell me a bit about it...</h2>
	<p>
"A wine glass for beer!?" Yep, an oversized 22oz wine glass will be most suitable for serving most Belgian Ales. Its size allows for headspace, while the open bowl creates an amazing nose. A lot of smart beer bars are now serving their Belgian Ales in these. It also makes for a great crossover conversational piece. "Is that wine that you're drinking?" And you reply, "No, it's De Ranke XX Bitter from Belgium. Wanna try?" 	</p>
	<h2>Why should I use this glass?</h2>
	<p>
		Replaces the Tulip or Goblet glasses.
		<br>
		An excellent conversational piece.
	</p>
	<h2>I got that, when is this glass appropriate?</h2>
		Black Ale <br>
		Double / Imperial IPA <br>
		American Wild Ale <br>
		Belgian IPA <br>
		Belgian Pale <br>
		Old Ale <br>
